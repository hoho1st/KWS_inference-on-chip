# KWS_inference-on-chip

We will pre-train a KWS model offline, then extract the computations related structure, activation functions and weight layers of the trained model to implement on the chip, to achieve KWS inference on chip. 

This approach prioritizes low-power, low-latency solutions, making it an ideal contender for the chipIgnite challenge.
